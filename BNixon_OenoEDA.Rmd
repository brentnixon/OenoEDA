 - First, I load in the packages that will be used in the project.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
# Load all of the packages that you end up using in your analysis in this code
# chunk.

# Notice that the parameter "echo" was set to FALSE for this code chunk. This
# prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output. You should set
# echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file, unless it makes sense for your
# report to show the code that generated a particular plot.

library(ggplot2) # for making plots
library(scales)
library(dplyr) # for transforming data
library(tidyr) 
library(gridExtra) # for arranging plots
library(grid) # another for plots
library(memisc) # makes table of estimates for linear model
library(lattice) # to make histogram with relative frequency
library(directlabels)
library(GGally) # to plot correlation matrix
```

- Then, I set the working directory to the right folder, and verify the 
presence of the files I need to load the data. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Set_Working_Directory}
# set the working directory and verify presence of necessary files
setwd("/Users/brentan/Documents/DAND/Projects/EDA")
#getwd() 
#list.files()
```

- Once I've done that, I use the "*read.csv*" function to read the 
wineQualityReds csv into a new dataframe that I will call *"wn"*.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# read in the csv to a new dataframe 
wn <- read.csv("wineQualityReds.csv")
```

# Data Set

In this project, I will work with the (Red) Wine Quality data set. This data 
set looks at 1599 instances of red wines from the Portugues '*Vinho Verde*' 
wine.
There are 12 attributes to describe each wine. Of these attributes, 11 are 
'physicochemical,' such as types of acidity, measures of certain chemicals, 
and density. The 12th attribute is a subjective measure of wine quality, a 
numeric score from 0 to 10, calculated as the median of the score given by at 
least three wine experts. 

# Univariate Plots Section

Now, lets dive in to the data. First, I'll run *dim* on the dataframe I 
created earlier to confirm how many observations I have and how many attributes
pertain to each one. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1a}
dim(wn)
```

1599 observations of 13 variables. I thought there were only 12 variables, so
to look into what the 13th is, I will run *str* on the dataframe.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1b}
str(wn)
```

I see that the extra variable is the first one, 'X', which appears to be the 
observation number, a serial ID starting at 1. Apart from the X and quality 
variables, all the other variables are numeric. There aren't any factors, but I 
think that quality would be good candidate to convert as it is essentially an 
ordered factor already. 

Now I'd like to run *summary* on the dataframe to get a statistical overview of 
each variable. I'll be looking at the range of values, and for suggestions of
outliers and skew in the data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1c}
summary(wn)
```

At first glance, there appear to be several variables that are positively skewed
and that possibly have outliers. To further examine this hunch, I will create 
boxplots of every variable to visually check for asymmetries. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1d}
b1 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = fixed.acidity), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b2 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = volatile.acidity), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b3 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = citric.acid), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b4 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = residual.sugar), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b5 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = chlorides), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b6 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b7 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b8 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = density), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b9 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = pH), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b10 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = sulphates), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b11 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = alcohol), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b12 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = quality), data = wn) + geom_boxplot() 

grid.arrange(b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12, ncol = 6,
    nrow = 2)
```

From these boxplots, I can very easily see whether a distribution has outliers.
I cannot as easily get a feel for how the different distributions are skewed. For 
that, I'll chart the same variables, but with histograms instead. 

From this group plot, I can see that the plots of some variables could be 
productively clustered together for better view and ease of comparison. I'll do
that now, clustering measures of acidity, sugar and chlorides, measures of 
sulfur, and a group with density, pH, alcohol, and quality.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_acids}
b1 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = fixed.acidity), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b2 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = volatile.acidity), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b3 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = citric.acid), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()

grid.arrange(b1, b2, b3, ncol = 3, nrow = 1)
```

These first three plots, which describe different measures of acidity, all have 
positive outliers. Fixed and volatile acidity have many, whereas citric acid 
only has one. The fixed and volatile acidity plots are slightly positively skewed 
and the citric acid plot is moderately positively skewed. These variables are 
all measured in g/dm^3.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_sugchlor}
b4 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = residual.sugar), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b5 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = chlorides), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()

grid.arrange(b4, b5, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

Residual sugar and chlorides have similar plots, with narrow and symmetric bands 
of non-outlier data, and many positive outliers across a large range. The 
chlorides plot also has a few (directionally) negative outliers. Both residual
sugar and chlorides are measured in g/dm^3.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_sulfur}
b6 <-  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b7 <-  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b10 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = sulphates), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()

grid.arrange(b6, b7, b10, ncol = 3, nrow = 1)
```

Following the apparent trend where measures of similar properties plot in
similar ways, the two measures of sulfur dioxide show a pattern of positively 
skewed non-outlier data and two clusters of positive outliers. The sulphates 
plot has a fairly symmetrical distribution of non-outlier data, followed by three 
clusters of positive outliers. Free and total sulfur dioxide are measured in 
mg/dm^3, and sulphates is measured in g/dm^3. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_other}
b8 <-  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = density), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b9 <-  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = pH), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b11 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = alcohol), data = wn) + geom_boxplot()
b12 <- ggplot(aes(x = "", y = quality), data = wn) + geom_boxplot() 

grid.arrange(b8, b9, b11, b12, ncol = 4, nrow = 1)
```

I don't believe that density and pH are fundamentally related in wine, but their
plots are fairly similar, with a roughly symmetric grouping of non-outlier data
and a fair amount of both positive and negative outliers. Alcohol has a pretty 
unremarkable plot. Unlike all the other variables, quality skews somewhat positive
with symmetrically placed positive and negative outliers. Density is measured in 
g/cm^3, pH is its own scale (0-14), alcohol is %, and quality is 0-10 integer score. 

Those boxplots were good for looking at the amount of outliers, but the skew of 
the data was not as easy to grasp. I think that histograms are an easier way to 
examine skew, so I will plot these variables with histograms.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_histo}
p1 <-  ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p2 <-  ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p3 <-  ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p4 <-  ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p5 <-  ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p6 <-  ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p7 <-  ggplot(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p8 <-  ggplot(aes(x = density), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p9 <-  ggplot(aes(x = pH), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p10 <- ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p11 <- ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wn) + geom_histogram()
p12 <- ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wn) + geom_histogram()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p12, ncol = 3, 
      nrow = 4)
```

From this group plot, you can clearly see that many of these measurements are 
positively skewed. In others, apart from the effect of outliers, the distributions 
are normal to slightly right skewed. Density and pH, on the other hand, are just
nice normal distributions. 

All of the variables, except pH and density, look like they could benefit from a 
logarithmic scale transformation. I will plot them to see if there is any 
apparent benefit.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_histo_logtrans}
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(5, 10, 14))
p2 <- ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="sqrt",breaks = c(.25, .5, 1.))
p3 <- ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_log10()
p4 <- ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(1,2.5,5,10))
p5 <- ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(.05,.1,.2))
p6 <- ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(5,15,40))
p7 <- ggplot(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
      scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(10,30,100))

p10 <- ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
       scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(.4,.6,1))

p11 <- ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wn) + geom_histogram() + 
       scale_x_continuous(trans="log10",breaks = c(9,11,13))

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p10, p11, ncol = 3, nrow = 3)
```

After adding a log10 transformation to their x-axes, most of these plots appear 
to be more normally distributed, which suggests that they are lognormally 
distributed. A few of the variables, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, and alcohol,
did not respond as well to the transformation as others. The logarithmic 
transformation should work well on data whose values span orders of magnitude.
Since none of these variables really do that, I'm not surprised that some of the 
transformations were not particularly effective.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univar_Plots_hist_BucketQual}
wn$`Quality Bucket` <- cut(wn$quality, c(1,4,6,10), 
                          labels = c("Bad", "Good", "Excellent"))

p12 <- ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wn) + 
       geom_histogram()
p13 <- ggplot(aes(x = `Quality Bucket`), data = wn) + 
       geom_histogram(stat = "count")

grid.arrange(p12, p13, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
```

Later in this project, I decided to group the quality data into three categories, 
good, bad, and excellent, and then break down a few plots by those categories. I
realized it could also be helpful to understanding the distribution of wines by 
quality in this section, so I added a wine quality histogram doing just that. 

The figure above shows the histograms of quality and quality bucket, respectively.
The quality buckets are 1-4, 5-6, and 7-10, representing bad, good, and 
excellent quality. Armed with that information and comparing the two chart 
side-by-side, it makes sense that the good bucket would be dramatically larger
than the bad or excellent bucket. The histogram of the individual scores shows 
that wines with score 5 or 6 comprise most of the sample. Additionally, the 
excellent bucket gets a bump from the decent amount of wines with a score of 7.

# Univariate Analysis

#### Structure of the Dataset
The dataset is composed of 1599 records, each described by the 12 variables:

* "fixed.acidity"
* "volatile.acidity"
* "citric.acid"
* "residual.sugar"
* "chlorides"
* "free.sulfur.dioxide"
* "total.sulfur.dioxide"
* "density"
* "pH"
* "sulphates"
* "alcohol"
* "quality"  

All the variables are numeric, except quality, which has integers and could 
probably be converted to a factor. 

All but three variables (pH, density, and quality) display at least some positive
skew. This means that the majority of wines cluster within a certain range, but
some wines have very high measures.

Almost all the wines score either a 5 or 6 on the quality scale, with a few 7s, 
and the occasional 3-4 or 8. This means that most wines are pretty good, but a few
are amazing and a few are pretty darn bad.

#### Main feature(s) of interest

The main feature of interest in the dataset is the measure of wine quality. Even 
if one is a wine expert, individual measures, like free sulfur dioxide, are going
to be hard to interpret. Using such a value to explain a pattern in quality, 
however, seems much more likely. As a non-wine expert, I would guess that alcohol
and sugar content could be two variables that are more easily interpretable or
predictive of quality than others. 

#### Potentially helpful features

I think that combining all the variables into a regression model will end up
providing the most signal from them. 

#### New variables
I did not create any new variables. I will, however, convert the quality scale
into an ordered factor.

#### Data adjustments

I adjusted the scale on the plots of a few of the variables, residual.sugar, 
chlorides, total.sulfur.dioxide, and sulphates, using a logarithmic transformation.
Doing so improved all of them, suggesting lognormal distributions.

# Bivariate Plots Section

Since I am trying to uncover patterns in the data, and relationships between 
variables, focusing my efforts with measures of correlation between variables 
can give me a headstart on that process. Below, I will plot a correlation 
matrix which shows the correlation coefficients between all the variables.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, BiVariate_CorrMatrix}
ggcorr(data=wn[,-1], label=T, label_size = 3, hjust=.9, layout.exp=2)
```

The correlation matrix shows that there are a few variables with high and medium
correlations, and many with low correlations. Some of the high correlations don't
really have much signal, as they are correlations between very similar variables, 
like citric acid and volatile acidity, or total sulfur dioxide and free sulfur 
dioxide. These high correlations would be similar to a high correlation between
ticket sales and total attendance at a sporting event, they are too connected to 
produce signal. 

The variables with medium to high correlations that are reasonably independent
of each other are:

- residual sugar to density: 0.4
- sulphates to chlorides: 0.4
- alcohol to quality: 0.5
- fixed acidity to density: 0.7

- alcohol to density: -0.5
- volatile acidity to quality: -0.5

Both high and negative correlations are interesting. Some of these correlations 
seem explainable by simple physics, but others could yield some unexpected 
patterns. For example, as sugar increases, density goes up. This is simple, you 
dissolve more solid into a liquid, the density increases. As alcohol increases,
density decreases. Since alcohol is less dense than water, this makes sense. The 
less obvious relationships are sulphates to chlorides, alcohol to quality, and 
volatile acidity to quality. It will be useful to explore those relationships in
greater detail.

Additionally, I'm curious about dividing variables between things that make a 
wine good, and things that make a wine bad. In other words, we know that high 
acetic acid and high total sulfur dioxide probably make a wine bad, because it 
tastes like vinegar or smells like rotten eggs. On the other hand, there are 
wine-making factors like sulphates* added, sugar in the wine, and how acidic the
wine is allowed to get. I'm pretty sure that these factors can be controlled by 
the winemaker, and therefore could correlate to striking successes. 

*Sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, 
wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

*Volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels 
can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.

*Total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, 
SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, 
SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_alc_sugar}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = residual.sugar), data = wn) + geom_point(alpha =.1) 
cor.test(wn$alcohol, wn$residual.sugar)
```

Plotting alcohol vs residual sugar shows that most wines have less than 1 g/L sugar,
and that those wines range from around 9 to 14% alcohol. As alcohol increases, the
highest ranges of residual sugar in wines decreases, from around 16 g/L to about
6 g/L. This makes sense as wines with higher alcohol have converted more of the 
fuel, sugar, into alcohol. This weak trend is only visible in the a handful of points.
As the correlation test shows, there is no real relationship between alcohol
and residual sugar.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_alc_quality}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(height = .4, alpha = .2) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, size=1)
cor.test(wn$alcohol, wn$quality) 
```

This plot suggests a moderate relationship between alcohol and quality. In the 
highest and lowest ranges of quality, there is a weak (created by few data points)
trend of higher alcohol associating with higher quality, and vice versa. A 
stronger trend is that 'good' wines (with scores from 5-7) span a broad range of
alcohol content, between 9 and 11%, as well as demonstrating a the same trend of
higher alcohol correlating with higher quality. The correlation test yields a 
0.48 correlation between alcohol and quality. The blue line is a linear model 
fit to the data and demonstrates the positive trend.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_sug_quality}
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = .16, height = .75) 
cor.test(wn$residual.sugar, wn$quality)
```

Plotting residual sugar vs quality shows that most wines have a residual sugar 
content between 1 and 3 g/L. The better wines (score of 4-8) have more outliers
with sugar content out to 15 g/L, but they almost entirely cluster between 1 and 3 
g/L. As the correlation test shows, there is almost zero relationship between 
residual sugar and quality. 

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_pH_qual}
ggplot(aes(x = pH, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(height = .4, alpha=.25) 
cor.test(wn$pH, wn$quality)
```

As shown by the correlation test, there is essentially no relationship between
pH and quality. Most wines fall within a pH of 3.1 and 3.6 and the average 
quality wines span a broader range of pH than the better and worse wines.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_sulph_qual}
ggplot(aes(x = sulphates, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = .2, height = .45) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, size=1)

cor.test(wn$sulphates, wn$quality)                                                          
```

As correlation test show, there is only a weak positive relationship between 
sulphates content and quality. The blue line represents the linear model fit to
the data, and shows the trend of this relationship. The average score wines have 
a wider range sulphate content. 

I was hoping to find some interesting relationships between sugar, pH, sulphates,
alcohol and quality, but except for alcohol, and to some extent, sulphates, there 
weren't any notable patterns. Since the first set of positive drivers didn't turn 
up much, I can't help but want to check three likely negative drivers: total sulfur 
dioxide, volatile acidity, and chlorides.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_TotSulf_qual}
ggplot(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = .25, height = 1)
cor.test(wn$total.sulfur.dioxide, wn$quality)                                                     
```

Very little to see here. There is a small negative correlation between total sulfur
dioxide and quality. As wines get lower in quality, there is some trend of them 
having higher total sulfur dioxide measures.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_VolAcid_qual}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = .25, height = 1) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, size=1)

cor.test(wn$volatile.acidity, wn$quality)                                                          
```

There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.49) between volatile acidity and quality. As
wines get lower in quality, they tend to have higher volatile acidity. The blue 
linear regression line shows this negative trend.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Chlor_qual}
ggplot(aes(x = chlorides, y = quality), data = wn) + 
    geom_jitter(alpha = .1, height = .45)
cor.test(wn$chlorides, wn$quality)                                                          
```

There is only a very very weak negative relationship (-0.13) between chlorides 
and quality. There are a handful of wines with average scores who have a wide 
range of chloride content.

# Bivariate Analysis

From the correlation tests and bivariate plots, only a few weak to moderate
relationships were uncovered. The strongest positive correlation was 0.48 between 
alcohol and quality. The only other notable positive correlation was 0.25 between
sulphates and quality. The strongest negative correlation was -0.39 between volatile
acidity and quality. The next was -0.19 between total sulfur dioxide and quality. 
The last notable negative correlation was -0.13 between chlorides and quality. 

I don't understand why higher alcohol content would be related to higher quality, 
but there was medium correlation between the two. The small positive correlation 
between sulphates and quality makes sense because sulphates are added to help control
fermentation processes and prevent the wine from going bad. 

The respective negative correlations between volatile acidity, sulfur dioxide, 
chlorides, and quality also makes sense because wines that taste like vinegar, 
smell like rotten eggs, or are salty probably aren't very high quality. The descending
order of correlation strength between those three variables and quality could be 
owing to the discernability of each attribute. Maybe acetic acid is easier to 
detect than total sulfur dioxide, which is easier to detect than chloride content.

# Multivariate Plots Section

There are a few plots I would like to explore with more than two variables. For 
starters, I would like to group the quality data into three categories, good, 
bad, and excellent, and then break down a few plots by those categories.

Here are the three plots I will explore:

* facet the plot of alcohol vs residual sugar by good, bad, and excellent to get
a better visual understanding of that relationship in different quality wines

* facet sulphates vs total sulfur dioxide by quality bracket to see if bad wines
added too much sulphate, not enough, or both, and conversely, if the excellent 
wines added a sweet spot of sulphate

* facet pH vs volatile acidity by quality bracket to see if there is a relationship
between the two, and if there are any patterns to that relationship visible in
quality bracket

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_QualityGroups}
wn$`Quality Bucket` <- cut(wn$quality, c(1,4,6,10), 
                          labels = c("Bad", "Good", "Excellent"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_alc_sugar_quality}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = residual.sugar), data = wn) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .15) + facet_wrap(~wn$`Quality Bucket`) + 
    geom_line(aes(x = median(alcohol)))  
```

The above chart shows residual sugar plotted against alcohol, faceted by quality
bracket, with the overall median alcohol content shown by the vertical lines.
The pattern I see is that a majority of both the worst and best wines have an 
alcohol content less than the overall median alcohol content. Thd best wines, on 
the other hand, almost all have an alcohol content fairly higher than the median.
Except for the good wines, alcohol does not seem to have a relationship with 
residual sugar. The slight relationship visible with good wines could simply be 
owing there being many more data points for that quality bracket.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_sulph_so2_quality}
ggplot(aes(x = sulphates, y = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wn) + 
    geom_point(alpha = .15) + facet_wrap(~wn$`Quality Bucket`) + 
    geom_line(aes(x = median(sulphates)))                                                                 
```

The relationship we see in this plot is that bad wines have a sulphate content 
slightly below the median value (shown again by vertical lines), good wines have
a below-median content, but a little less below than that of bad wines. Lastly, 
excellent wines have an above-median sulphate content.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_pH_volatileAcidity_quality}
ggplot(aes(x = pH, y = volatile.acidity), data = wn) + geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
    facet_wrap(~`Quality Bucket`) + geom_line(aes(x = median(pH)))    
```

From this last plot, we can see that the bad wines generally have a pH above the 
pH median (shown by vertical lines). Also, more of them have higher volatile acidity 
measurements than the excellent wines. In other words, they have low acidity and 
are often slightly vinegary (mmm...). Good wines usually straddle the pH median,
but are lower in volatile acidity than bad wines. Excellent wines, however, are 
a bit lower in acidity than the others as well as having the lowest amount of 
volatile acidity among the three quality brackets. 

I couldn't help but try to fit the data to a linear model. I made eleven versions
of the model, starting with one variable, and updating each subsequent model with 
an additional variable. By the end, the R-squared value was 0.361, which isn't the 
best.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_LinearMod}
wnm1 <- lm(quality ~ fixed.acidity, data = wn)
wnm2 <- update(wnm1, ~ . + volatile.acidity)
wnm3 <- update(wnm2, ~ . + citric.acid)
wnm4 <- update(wnm3, ~ . + residual.sugar)
wnm5 <- update(wnm4, ~ . + chlorides)
wnm6 <- update(wnm5, ~ . + free.sulfur.dioxide)
wnm7 <- update(wnm6, ~ . + total.sulfur.dioxide)
wnm8 <- update(wnm7, ~ . + density)
wnm9 <- update(wnm8, ~ . + pH)
wnm10 <- update(wnm9, ~ . + sulphates)
wnm11 <- update(wnm10, ~ . + alcohol)

mtable(wnm1, wnm2, wnm3, wnm4, wnm5)
mtable(wnm6, wnm7, wnm8, wnm9, wnm10, wnm11)
```

After building the model, I used the *predict* function to create a predicted 
quality score for each wine in the data set. Since the predict function yielded 
predictions with decimal valuesbut the actual quality scores are integers, I used 
the *round* function to convert the predictions into integers. 

To check the accuracy of these rounded predictions, I plotted the difference
between each wine's quality score and the model prediction. As you can see below, 
about 60% of the predictions were correct, which is not terrible. It appears that
the model predicted a bit high more than it did low. Some further areas to explore 
with this model would be refitting it with log-transformed data or 95th 
percentile data.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivar_PredictionErrors}
wn$predicted <- predict(wnm11)   
wn$roundpredict <- round(wn$predicted)
wn$predictDiff<- wn$quality - wn$roundpredict

histogram(x = wn$predictDiff)
```

# Multivariate Analysis

In this past section, I looked at the relationships between alcohol and residual 
sugar, sulphates and total sulfur dioxide, and pH and volatile acidity. I cut the
quality variable into three brackets, bad, good, and excellent, and broke the 
three plots down by these brackets.

The goal of adding this third variable was to use the quality information to 
infer some pattern about how my assumed independent variables affected the 
dependent ones like total sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity and residual sugar 
content in a way that drove a difference in quality. 

My overall summary is that the best wines are not sweet and range from 10-12% alcohol.
Bad wines are lower in sulphates, good wines are higher in sulphates, but total 
sulfur dioxide does not seem to be related to that sulphate content. Bad wines have 
higher volatile acidity and lower total acidity (pH). The best wines have lower 
volatile acidity and a bit lower total acidity than most.

The linear model I built had an r-squared of 0.361 and about 60% accuracy in 
predicting wine quality. Since there are so many more good wines than bad or 
excellent wines, I wouldn't be surprised if the prediction accuracy is worse for 
bad and excellent wines because there were fewer data points in those ranges. Possible
options for improving the model include using log-transformed data and data trimmed
to the 95th percentiles.

### Description One
I chose to use this plot because it gives a large amount of information about
the entire dataset in one fairly simple figure. You can see the pervasive positive 
skew across many of the variables, as well as seeing which attributes relate
to each other categorically (e.g. types of acidity) and which attributes aren't 
necessarily related, but have similar structure regarding central tendency, skew,
and number of outliers.

### Description Two
I chose this plot, of residual sugar against alcohol, faceted by quality bucket,
because it is one of the few plots where there was a noticeable trend. The three 
panels show how alcohol and sugar content relate to each other for bad, good, and 
excellent wines. Superimposed on each panel are vertical lines repreShow in New WindowClear OutputExpand/Collapse Output

median alcohol content for wines in each particular quality bucket, as well as 
overall. 

For bad wines, we see that the median alcohol content is below the median for all 
wines. There is only one wine with a residual sugar content above ~8 g/dm^3, which 
is probably reflective of the low number of samples for this quality bucket.

Good wines are similar to bad wines, with below-median alcohol content, although
there is a weak negative linear trend between alcohol content and residual sugar
that was not apparent in bad wines.

Excellent wines have an alcohol content that is above-median with a spread 
noticeably greater than that seen in the lower two quality buckets. For the lower 
two quality buckets there are also a few more wines with higher sugar content
(> ~8 g/dm^3) than there are for excellent wines, of which there are none above
~8 g/dm^3.

### Description Three
I like this plot because it shows a slight pattern that I was curious about earlier
in the project. The pattern was regarding sulphate content, total sulfur dioxide,
and quality. This plot demonstrates that pattern by plotting total sulfur dioxide
against sulphates, and separating by quality bucket. 

In the plot above, you can see that the bad wines have a slightly above-median 
sulphate content. The good wines have a sulphate content close to the overall 
median. Excellent wines have a moderately below-median sulphate content.

As far as sulphate content being related to total sulfur dioxide levels, it appears
maybe that the good wines have more higher values. I suspect that this is simply 
owing to there being quite a lot more good wines than bad or excellent.

In summary, the most noticeable pattern is the below-median sulphate content of 
excellent wines.

# Reflection

Looking back on this project, I got to break out twelve different attributes of 
1599 red wines. Another way to look at this data set is 11 features that point 
towards a target variable, the quality score. I gained intuition about the data
set by plotting all the variables with boxplots and histograms, and by running 
statistical summaries of the variables. 

From then on, I compared multiple variables to each other, looking for patterns 
and relationships that would give me insight into how physico-chemical attributes 
of these wines affect each other and contribute to quality. I did this by making 
scatter plots, faceting by quality, superimposing measures of central tendency, 
as well as by calculating correlations between the same sets of variables to 
check for, and quantify any such relationships.

There were some moderate relationships between variables and quality. The most notable
were between alcohol and quality, with a positive correlation was 0.48, between volatile
acidity and quality, with a negative correlation of 0.39, and between sulphates 
quality, with a positive correlation of 0.25. Building a linear regression model
with all the features gave an R-squared value of 0.361, which was underwhelming.

One big struggle with this data is that there are many more good wines than there 
are bad or excellent ones. In the buckets with fewer samples, it seems likely that 
a representative distribution of values for each variable is not seen, which makes
it harder to compare with good wines and to draw conclusions. 

One way to make this data set a _lot_ more interesting would be to add in location, 
winemaker, varietal, and pricing information. Getting more samples in the bad and 
excellent quality ranges would also really improve the data. Lastly, it would be
interesting to run this data through some machine learning algorithms to build a
prediction engine better than the linear regression model that I made.
