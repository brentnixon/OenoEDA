# OenoEDA

Exploratory data analysis project in R, using a dataset of 1599 red wines, each which is described by 12 physico-chemical attributes and one subjective quality score.

I leveraged descriptive statistics and visualizations built with ggplot2 to gain intuition about the data set and uncover relationships between variables.
